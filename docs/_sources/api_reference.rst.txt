API Reference
=============

Wrapper around the python requests module for ease of interaction with all CloudCIX services

Basic usage: ``cloudcix.api.<application>.<service>.<method>``

More detailed usage information will be available under each of the above terms

To see even more details about the API you can visit our `HTTP API Reference <https://docs.cloudcix.com/>`_

To see more information about the various methods (list, read, etc.), see the :doc:`client` page

For examples of a call for each of these methods, see the :doc:`examples` page

.. note:: Any service that implements the ``update`` method also implements the
  ``partial_update`` method, which does the same thing without needing to pass
  a full representation of the object, only the fields that need updating
