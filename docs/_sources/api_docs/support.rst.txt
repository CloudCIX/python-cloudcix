The Support application is both a ticketing system, and a returns management system

.. note:: **Ticketing System**

    A Ticketing System has two parties, each with a different role.

    A Warrantor offers support, and a Client requires support

.. note:: **Returns Management**

    If a ticket requires that a product is returned for repair, exchange, or credit, then a Service Centre also becomes involved
