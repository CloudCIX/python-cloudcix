Services
--------

Circuit
^^^^^^^
This service allows Users to manage their Circuits

A Circuit is a device installed in your active Address

**Basic Usage**: ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.<method>``

Available Methods
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.list``
        - Returns a list of Circuits by owner, customer and supplier
          based on the User's Address
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.create``
        - This method allows the User to add a Circuit to a Circuit
          Class
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.read``
        - This method allows the User to get the details of a given
          Circuit
        - Only owners, customers and suppliers are allowed to read a
          Circuit
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.update``
        - Allows the User to update a Circuit
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit.delete``
        - Allows the User to delete a Circuit
        - If a Circuit has been removed but the User wants to maintain
          it in the list, it should be updated with a decommission date

Circuit Class
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This service allows for the management of Circuit Classes

A Circuit Class is a classification for the Circuits

**Basic Usage**: ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit_class.<method>``

Available Methods
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit_class.list``
        - Returns a list of Circuit Classes and their supported
          Properties
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit_class.create``
        - Allows the User to create a new Circuit Class for its Member
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit_class.read``
        - Allows the User to get the details of a given Circuit Class
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.circuit_class.update``
        - Allows the User to update a Circuit Class.
        - If there are Circuits under the Circuit Class, new properties
          cannot be required and old properties cannot be removed or
          renamed


Property Type
^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This service is in place to offer a list of the supported Property Types

A Property Type is an identification of the expected input value for a given
property.

**Basic Usage**: ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.property_type.<method>``

Available Methods
    - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.property_type.list``
        - Returns a list of Property Types

Property Value
^^^^^^^^^^^^
This service allows to search Circuit objects properties dictionaries by the value sent in the request. 

**Basic Usage**: ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.property_value.<method>``

Available Methods
  - ``cloudcix.api.Circuit.property_value.list``
    - Allows the User to list all properties of their Circuits where the queries `search_term` is included. 
    -  It will return a list of objects for each property value the term was included in, with reference keys to identify the Circuit. 
    - This list will be alphabetical based on the value of the property.
