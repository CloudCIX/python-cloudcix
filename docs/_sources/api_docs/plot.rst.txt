Source Group Summary
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This services allows to view the summary of Readings for a group of Sources.

A Source Group Summary is a summary of the Readings for a group of Source for a specific period and defined interval.

A group of Sources is defined by the `source` parameter in the endpoint and the `unit_id` and `accumulating` search parameters

**Basic Usage**: ``cloudcix.api.Plot.source_group_summary.<method>``

Available Methods
    - ``cloudcix.api.Plot.source_group_summary.list``
        - Return a summary of Readings for a source.
        - Required params are:
            - `'search[accumulating]'`: A flag stating if the sources should be grouped by acculating values.
            - `'search[unit_id]'`: The ID of the unit the sources should be grouped by.
            - `'search[start_date]'`: The date the summary report will start from.
            - `'search[end_date]'`: The date the summary report will end at.
            - `'search[interval]'`: The interval to group the readings by. This is required to be a string starting with a number followed by one of the following characters, `d`, `m`, `q`, `y`
                - `d`: day e.g. `'search[interval]': '2d'` Interval is two days
                - `m`: month e.g. `'search[interval]': '4m'` Interval is four months
                - `q`: quarter e.g. `'search[interval]': '1q'` Interval is one quarter
                - `y`: year e.g. `'search[interval]': '1y'` Interval is one year
